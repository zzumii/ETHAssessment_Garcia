## Creating a token in ETH 

Through the creation and execution of token transactions on Ethereum, this solidity program's simple token generator uses Solidity's fundamental features. This project aims to assist users in comprehending the functionality of executing a program in Solidity and demonstrating how it operates. 

## Description 

It uses Solidity's fundamental features to demonstrate how it generates or allocates tokens to accounts. Moreover, Ethereum uses Solidity's computer language to create smart contracts or programs kept on a blockchain. This program has functions that may be customized at the user's expense, allowing them to create token values and add and subtract them. The program will give a general understanding of how the Solidity programming language interacts with the Ethereum Blockchain. 

## Getting Started 

### Where to Access 
To run this program you may use REmix, which is an online Solidity IDE. To get starte and use the code provided, go to Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Executing the Program 
Once you are inside the IDE, click on the "+" buttong on the left-hand sidebar to create a new file inside the existing workspace, or create a new workspace for yourself depending on how you want to use it. After, save the file woth .sol extension at the end.
